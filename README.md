# Credit-Score-Classification
Classification of the Credit score, checking which factors affect it the most, and running three models: Logistic Regression, KNN, and CART.
In this project, we first clean and transform the dataset, the raw dataset is used from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification
Then we implement the model settings for the project. 
After that, we implement the 3 models and check which has the best accuracy among them.
Conclusion: CART has the highest accuracy with more than 80% correct prediction of the Credit Score.
